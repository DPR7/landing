Classes & Objects in PHP


Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming style that is intended to make thinking about programming closer to thinking about the real world.

Objects are created using classes, which are the focal point of OOP.
The class describes what the object will be, but is separate from the object itself. 
In other words, a class can be thought of as an object's blueprint, description, or definition.
Take a look at the following examples:contentImageHere, 

Building is a class. It defines the features of a generic building and how it should work.
The Empire State Building is a specific object (or instance) of that class.
You can use the same class as a blueprint for creating multiple different objects.
