As we’ve mentioned, Yoast SEO allows you to use canonicals to prevent duplicate content. 
The content analysis provides feedback on your keywords, including where you should use them. 
You can redirect deleted pages so your audience and Google won’t get stuck on 404s. 
Internal linking greatly improves your site structure for both the user and Google.

As we’ve explained, some markets are more competitive than others. 
If you are in a relatively obscure niche, you can try to rank for more general terms. 
If your competition is stiff, you should identify what sets you apart and 
devise a keyword strategy with longer terms your competition has not optimized for. 
It also depends on whether people are searching for you. 
In this example, people probably don’t know about Wonderturf, 
and there are few competitors, which makes it very easy to rank.
