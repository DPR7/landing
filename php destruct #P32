PHP Class Destructor

Similar to the class constructor, there is a destructor magic method __destruct(),
which is automatically called when an object is destroyed.
For example:

This script creates a new Person object. When the script ends the object is automatically destroyed, 
which calls the destructor and outputs the message "Object destroyed".

To explicitly trigger the destructor, you can destroy the object using the unset() function in a statement similar to: unset($p);
Destructors are useful for performing certain tasks when the object finishes its lifecycle. 
For example, release resources, write log files, close a database connection, and so on.

PHP releases all resources when a script finishes its execution.
