PHP Interfaces


An interface specifies a list of methods that a class must implement. 
However, the interface itself does not contain any method implementations. 
This is an important aspect of interfaces because it allows a method to be handled differently in each class that uses the interface.

The interface keyword defines an interface.
The implements keyword is used in a class to implement an interface.

For example, 

AnimalInterface is defined with a declaration for the makeSound() function, 
but it isn't implemented until it is used in a class:
A class can implement multiple interfaces. 
More than one interfaces can be specified by separating them with commas. 
For example:

class Demo implements AInterface, BInterface, CInterface {
  // Functions declared in interfaces must be defined here
}
PHP

An interface can be inherit another interface by using the extends keyword.
