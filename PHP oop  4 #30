$this


$this is a pseudo-variable that is a reference to the calling object. 
When working within a method, use $this in the same way you would use an object name outside the class.
For example:
We created two objects of the Dog class and called their display() methods. 
Because the display() method uses $this, the legs value referred to the appropriate calling objectâ€™s property value.
As you can see, each object can have its own values for the properties of the class.
