PHP Class Inheritance


Classes can inherit the methods and properties of another class. 
The class that inherits the methods and properties is called a subclass. 
The class a subclass inherits from is called the parent class.

Inheritance is achieved using the extends keyword.
For example:

Here the Dog class inherits from the Animal class. 
As you can see, all the properties and methods of Animal are accessible to Dog objects.

Parent constructors are not called implicitly if the subclass defines a constructor. 
However, if the child does not define a constructor then it will be inherited from the parent class if it is not declared private.
Notice all our properties and methods have public visibility.
For added control over objects, declare methods and properties using a visibility keyword. 
This controls how and from where properties and methods can be accessed.
