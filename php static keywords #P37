The static Keyword


The PHP static keyword defines static properties and static methods.
A static property/method of a class can be accessed without creating an object of that class.

A static property or method is accessed by using the scope resolution operator :: between the class name and the property/method name.

For example:
The self keyword is needed to access a static property from a static method in a class definition.

For example:
Objects of a class cannot access static properties in the class but they can access static methods.
