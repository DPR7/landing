PHP Visibility


Visibility controls how and from where properties and methods can be accessed.
So far, we have used the public keyword to specify that a property/method is accessible from anywhere.
There are two more keywords to declare visibility:
protected: Makes members accessible only within the class itself, by inheriting, and by parent classes.
private: Makes members accessible only by the class that defines them.

Class properties must always have a visibility type. 
Methods declared without any explicit visibility keyword are defined as public.
Protected members are used with inheritance.
Private members are used only internally in a class.
