PHP Objects


The process of creating an object of a class is called instantiation.
To instantiate an object of a class, use the keyword new, as in the example below:

$bob = new Person();
PHP
In the code above, $bob is an object of the Person class.

To access the properties and methods of an object, use the arrow (->) construct, as in:
echo $bob->age;
PHP
This statement outputs the value of the age property for $bob. 
If you want to assign a value to a property use the assignment operator = as you would with any variable.

Let's define the Person class, instantiate an object, make an assignment, and call the speak() method:

Run the code and see how it works!
