PHP Abstract Classes


Abstract classes can be inherited but they cannot be instantiated.
They offer the advantage of being able to contain both methods with definitions and abstract methods that aren't defined until they are inherited.

A class inheriting from an abstract class must implement all the abstract methods.

The abstract keyword is used to create an abstract class or an abstract method.

For example:
Abstract functions can only appear in an abstract class.
