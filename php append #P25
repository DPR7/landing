Appending to a File

If you want to append content to a file, you need to open the file in append mode.

For example:
$myFile = "test.txt";
$fh = fopen($myFile, 'a');
fwrite($fh, "Some text");
fclose($fh);
PHP
When appending to a file using the 'a' mode, 
the file pointer is placed at the end of the file, 
ensuring that all new data is added at the end of the file.
