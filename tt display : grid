When an HTML element on your page has display: grid or display: inline-grid applied to it,
you can see a grid badge next to it in the Elements panel. 
Click the badge to toggle the display of a grid overlay on the page.

The new Layout pane has a Grid section offering you a number of options for viewing the grids.
