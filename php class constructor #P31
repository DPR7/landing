PHP Class Constructor


PHP provides the constructor magic method __construct(), 
which is called automatically whenever a new object is instantiated.

For example:

The __construct() method is often used for any initialization that the object may need before it is used. 
Parameters can be included in __construct() to accept values when the object is created.

For example:

In the code above, the constructor uses arguments in the new statement to initialize corresponding class properties.
You can't write multiple __construct() methods with different numbers of parameters. 
Different constructor behavior must be handled with logic within a single __construct() method.
