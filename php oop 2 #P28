PHP Classes


In PHP, a class can include member variables called properties for defining the features of an object, 
and functions, called methods, for defining the behavior of an object. 
A class definition begins with the keyword class, followed by a class name. 
Curly braces enclose the definitions of the properties and methods belonging to the class.

For example:
class Person {
  public $age; //property
  public function speak() { //method
    echo "Hi!"
  }
}
PHP

The code above defines a Person class that includes an age property and a speak() method.
A valid class name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.
Notice the keyword public in front of the speak method; it is a visibility specifier.
The public keyword specifies that the member can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
There are other visibility keywords and we will learn about them in later lessons.
